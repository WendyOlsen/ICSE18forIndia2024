This repository holds multiple files supporting our paper about the International Classification of Status in Employment (ISCE) 2018 of International Labour Office (ILO).

The do files show Stata programming and there is also an Appdendix.  It shows how Excel can be used to make simulation estimates. We then graphed these in Stata.

Submitted paper, 2024. (Journal TBC)

The appendix shows how we did the construction of revised measures of the labour force, starting with Periodic Labour-Force Survey (PLFS) 2021/2022, then moving to India’s ICSE-18 statuses as simulated percentage estimates. 
It is necessary to include adults who are not in the labour force for this exercise, because the size of the labour force tends to be higher when we use ICSE18 for India.

So some adults are drawn in from the inactive group at step 1. 
Contents of the Appendix:
1.	TUS estimates  2.  PLFS Estimates  3. Simulation of PLFS revised for ILO concepts.
